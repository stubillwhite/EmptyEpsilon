-- Name: Weapons
-- Description: 
--- -------------------
--- [Operations (Weapon Stations) Info]
--- -------------------
--- Overview: 
--- It is important that the Operations Officers familiarise themselves with the weapon capabilities of the ship.
--- Each ship has a separate Weapon stations for operating beams and missiles. The missile station also controls the ship's turrets.
---
--- Data: 
--- - In the upper-left corner, the Weapons officer's screen displays the ship's energy (max is 1,500), and the strength of its front and rear shields.
---
--- Targeting:
--- - Selecting a ship on the Weapons stations' short-range radar will activite beam weapons, turrets and target guided missile weapons.
---
--- Missiles:
--- - Missiles are one of a ship's most destructive weapons, and they have to be loaded before use. Loading and unloading weapon tubes takes time. 
--- - Your ship is equipped to carry HVLI, EMP, Homing and Nuclear missiles, as well as mines.
---
--- Weapon Types:
--- Homing: 
--- - A simple, high-speed missile with a small warhead.
--- Nuke: 
--- - A powerful homing missile that deals tremendous damage to all ships within 1U of its detonation. 
--- - While your ship is equipped with two Nuclear missiles, they are currently disabled. To enable the use of Nuclear missiles, contact Warspite secutiry office.
--- Electromagentic Pulse (EMP): 
--- - A homing missile that deals powerful damage to the shields of all ships within 1U of detonation, but doesn't damage them physically.
--- High-velocity Lead Impactor (HVLI): 
--- - A group of 5 simple lead slugs fired in a single burst at extremely high velocity. These bolts don't home in on an enemy target.
--- Mine: 
--- - A powerful, stationary explosive that detonates when an object moves to within 1U of it. The explosion damages all objects within a 1U radius.
--- Beam Weapons: 
--- - The location and range of beam weapons are indicated by multicolour firing arcs originating from the ship. After the Weapons officer selects a target, the ship's beam weapons will automatically fire at that target when it is inside a beam's firing arc. The officer can use the frequency selectors at the bottom right, along with data about a target's shield frequencies provided by the Science team, to remodulate beams to a frequency that deals more damage. Note that you can change the beam frequency instantaneously.
--- - Beam weapons fire at a target's hull by default, but the Weapons officer can also target specific subsystems to disable an enemy.
--- - All ships are equipped with standard-issue energy beams. Depending on your ships' exact configuration, you may be equipped with Heat beams, which heat and disable your enemy's systems or EMP beam which specifically targets that ship's shields.
--- - Turrets are narrow beams which can change direction.
--- Be very careful when firing beams and missiles at the same time, as beams can disable your own missiles.
---
--- Shields: The Weapons officer is responsible for activating the ship's shields and modulating their frequency. It might be tempting to keep the shields up at all times, but they drain significantly more power when active. Certain shield frequencies are especially resistant to certain beam frequencies, which can also be detected in targets by the Science officer. Unlike beam weapons, however, remodulating the shields' frequency brings them offline for several seconds and leaves the ship temporarily defenseless.
