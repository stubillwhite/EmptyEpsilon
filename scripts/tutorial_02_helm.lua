-- Name: Helm
-- Description: 
--- -------------------
--- [Operations (Helms Station) Info]
--- -------------------
--- Overview: 
--- It is important that the Operations Officers familiarise themselves with the movement ability of the ship.
---
--- Data: 
--- - In the upper-left corner, the Helms officer's screen displays the ship's energy (max is 1,500), current heading in degrees, and current speed in Units/minute.
---
--- Engines: 
--- - The Helm screen includes two sliders
--- - The left slider controls the impulse engines, from -100% (full reverse) to 0% (full stop) to 100% (full ahead).
--- - The right slider controls the warp drive through 4 different speed settings (warp one through warp four).
---
--- Setting a Heading: 
--- - The Helms officer has a short-range radar. Pressing inside this radar sets the ship's heading in that direction. 
--- - Be sure to communicate bwtween each other when it combat, as beam weapons and certain missiles can only fire in the direction of the current heading.
---
--- Combat Maneuvers: 
--- - The Helms screen includes a Combat Maneuver panel. It allows your ship to make quick movement in any direction, and is best use sparingly to avoid collisions to missiles or haserdous terrain. Combat maneuvers can be exhausted but recharge over time.
---
--- Docking: 
--- -The Helms officer can dock with stations as well as other ships when they are within 1U. While docked, the ship can't engage its engines or fire weapons, but its energy recharges faster, repairs take less time, and the Relay officer can request missile weapon rearmament. The Helms officer is also responsible for undocking the ship.
---
--- Retrieving Objects: 
--- -The Helms officer may also responsible for piloting the ship into supply drops and other retrievable items.
