-- Description:
--- ------------------
--- [Main Screen and Radar Info]
--- -------------------
--- This tutorial covers not only the Command team's tasks, but also basics of some of the ship's operations.
--- Without direct control of the ship, Command team keeps the crew focused on their goal and helps the crew make crucial decisions. 
--- 
--- The Command tasks include:
--- - Planning the next actions
--- - Setting priorities
--- - Coordinating combat tactics
-- Type: Basic
