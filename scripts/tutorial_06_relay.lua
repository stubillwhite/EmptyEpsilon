-- Name: Relay
-- Description: 
--- -------------------
--- [Relay and Navigation Info]
--- -------------------
--- Overview:
--- It is important that Science and Operations officers familiarise themselves with this station.
---
--- Sector Map: 
--- - The Relay station can view a map of the sector, including space hazards and ships within short-range scanner range (5U). It can also see the short-range sensor data around probes and other UCN ships and stations, potentially spotting distant threats before the science station does. The Relay officer cannot scan ships, however.
--- - Navigation officer will be able to see this strategic map.
---
--- Probes: 
--- - Relay and strategic screens can launch up to 8 high-speed probes to any point in the sector. These probes fly toward a location and transmit short-range sensor data to the ship for 10 minutes. Probes work inside nebulae, and thus are powerful tools when faced with an area blocked by nebula. 
--- - Science officer at the Navigation screen can also link a probe's sensors to the Science station, which lets the Science officer scan ships within the probe's sensor range even if the probe is beyond the ship's long-range scanners. Probes cannot be retrieved and can be destroyed by enemies; your ship's stock of probes can be ressuplied by UCS Warspite.
---
--- Waypoints: 
--- - The Relay and Navigation officers can set waypoints. These waypoints appear on the Helms officer's short-range scanner and can guide the ship toward a destination or on a specific route through space. Waypoints are also necessary when requesting aid.
---
--- Communications: 
--- - The Relay officer can open communications with stations and other ships, and in some cases request to open audio or video communication channel. 
--- - Please remember to maintain a steady, polite tone when communicating with other vessels.
-- Type: Basic
