-- Name: Science
-- Description: 
--- -------------------
--- [Science Screens Info]
--- -------------------
--- Long-range Radar: 
--- - The Science station has a long-range radar that can locate ships and objects at a distance of up to 25U. The Science officer's most important task is to report the sector's status and any changes within it. On the edge of the radar are colored bands of signal interference that can vaguely suggest the presence of objects or space hazards even further from the ship. It's up to the Science team to interpret them.
---
--- Scanning: 
--- - You can scan ships to get more information about them. The Science officer must align two of the ship's scanning frequencies with a target to complete the scan. Scanning a ship, or any object, will reveal their IFF as well as other valuable information.
---
--- Deep Scans: 
--- - A second, more difficult scan yields more information about the ship, including its shield and beam frequencies. The Operations team can also see the firing arcs of deep-scanned ships, but they cannot see relevant frequencies, and you will have to relay this information to them.
--- - Link the scanned vessel or object to Analysis, to view all information about it on the same screen.
---
--- Nebulae: 
--- - Nebulae block the ship's long-range scanner. The Science officer cannot see what's inside or behind them, and while in a nebula the ship's radars cannot detect what's outside of it.
---
--- Probe View: 
--- - You can launch probes from Relay and Navigation screens, and those can be linked Science station, as well as have their own view screen. 
--- - The Science officer can view the probe's short-range sensor data to scan ships within its range, even if the probe is far from the ship's long-range scanners or in a nebula.
---
--- Database: 
--- - The Science officer can access the ship's database of all known ships, as well as data about weapons and space hazards. This can be vital when assessing a ship's capabilities without a deep scan, or for help navigating hazardous terrain.
