    -- See shipTemplate_Larp.lua for an example
    
    -- Change Power Use Factor
    -- Each system use a fixed amount of energy, affected by the power and the efficiency of the system. Here is the default values
    -- SYS_Reactor     -25.0 * 0.08,   (Negative factor seems Reactor produces energy)

You could also choose the discharge_rate_per_second, aka the number of oxygen decrease by second (0.1 by default) independently of another setting. And the recharge_rate_per_second parameter, aka the number of oxygen increase by second (0.1 by default) affected by the efficiency of oxygen system.
    -- Each zone must be set in the template file or in the script file, and can after be changed by tweak.

    -- Station and drone recorded in the database
    -- Nothing to do here, just to inform you that stations and drones template are now recorded in the database. Name of the button has changed (ships -> Templates) to keep consistency. This can be changed by translation.
    
    -- Dynamic Factions and Personality
    -- setPersonalityId can modify personality of object and behaviour with another object
    -- 0: Normal (with faction behaviour)

    -- Logs by station
    -- Logs can now append on several stations. You activate this feature in options.ini with the parameter server_config_logs_by_station. If enabled, logs are only visible in a station if at least one log entry exist for the considered station. Ship logs screen shown all the logs with an indication of the station.

    -- Instability for systems
    -- You can active a instability processus for one or many systems. If Instability factor is more than 0, instability is active. Instability Factor must be between 0.0 and 1.0 (float) and is the probability of change of sliders for instability control
    -- Instability Difficulty must be between 0 and 4 (integer), and is the number of slider to control the instability (like the scanning dialog)

    -- Nano repair system
    -- You can avoid using repair crew into room systems and use instead nano repair crew. nano repair crew works as coolant.
